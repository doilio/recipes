Ingredients

Sauce:
1 1/2 cups (375 mL) milk, divided
1/2 cup (125 mL) granulated sugar
2 tsp (10 mL) cornstarch
1/2 tsp (2 mL) vanilla

Cake:
1 cup (250 mL) all-purpose flour
2/3 cup (150 mL) granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp (7 mL) baking powder
1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt
1 egg
3/4 cup (175 mL) milk
3 tbsp (45 mL) butter, melted
2 tsp (10 mL) vanilla
(optional) icing sugar

Preparation
Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter an 8-inch (2 L) square glass baking dish.

Sauce: Transfer 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the milk to a small bowl. Heat remaining milk and sugar for 2 to 3 min or until steaming in a glass measuring cup in microwave on Medium (50%) power or in saucepan over medium heat on stove-top. Add cornstarch and vanilla to reserved milk; drizzle into hot milk mixture, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.

Cake: In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, whisk together egg, milk, butter and vanilla. Pour over dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. Spread into prepared baking dish. Gently pour warm milk mixture over cake batter without stirring.

Bake for about 30 min or until tester inserted in centre of cake layer comes out clean. Let cool for at least 15 min. Serve hot or warm. Dust with icing sugar (if using).Scoop cake into serving bowls and spoon pudding sauce over top.

Tips
The pudding forms on the bottom while this cake bakes. It’s best to serve it hot or warm before pudding soaks into the cake so plan to put into the oven before you sit down to dinner and it will be just right at dessert time.

Chai tea pudding cake: Add 2 Chai tea bags to milk in sauce before heating; discard before adding to baking dish. Add 1/2 tsp (2 mL) each ground cinnamon and ginger and 1/8 tsp (0.5 mL) ground cardamom to flour mixture.
